The "fs_report" component write submitted reports to the file system as
individual files.

Configuration
-------------

The component needs a configured virtual file system (vfs).

! <config verbose="yes">
! 	<vfs><fs/></vfs>
! </config>

The component can be configured to write all incoming reports to the LOG
output by setting the 'verbose' attribute of the '<config>' node to "yes".
