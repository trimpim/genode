This component analyzes a init state report and porduces an xml configuration
that can be feed in to a menu_view to analyze the memory and CAP consumation
inside this init.

Configuration
-------------

The following example shows the default values.

! <config monitor_caps="no"/>

The report from init needs at least to report child_ram. For capability monitoring
additionally child_caps are required.

This can be achived by adding the following to the config of init:

! <report init_ram="yes" init_caps="yes" child_ram="yes" child_caps="yes"/>
